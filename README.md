# ronchi

This program is only of interest to you if you are interested in
the Ronchi test, a mostly qualitative optical test used by many
amateur telescope makers.  If you don't know what that is, you
probably won't find any of this interesting, and even if you do
know what this is, you probably would be better off using a 
more user friendly program such as Ronchi for Windows.  I wrote
the first version of this code while I was writing a book on 
telescope making.

This version has been modified to allow the generation of patterns
for arbitrary conic surfaces by specifying different conic constants.

# Addendum

I recently added a version that is written in the Python program language.
You might consider the C version deprecated, although I am leaving it here.
